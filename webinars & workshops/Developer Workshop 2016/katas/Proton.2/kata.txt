Starting from the point of completing the Proton.1 task.  Write a function that gets the dose at a given volume from the Plan and Uncertainty plan curves.  You should use GetDoseAtVolume as a guide.  Then for the structure "CTV_5200" use that function to display the Min, Max and Average D95%[cGy] for the plan and uncertainty plans collection.  Patient “ABDOMEN, TG244” has a proton plan called “Proton Uncert” in course “C2” that can be used for testing and solution verification.
