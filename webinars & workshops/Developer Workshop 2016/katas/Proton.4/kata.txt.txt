Create a custom proton post processing script: go through all the layers of a proton spot scanning plan and implement energy-dependent minimum and/or maximum spot MU limits. The energy-dependence can be whatever you like, for example you can give the values for 70 and 250 MeV and interpolate the intermediate ones. Because this script uses writing features, it needs to be a Binary plug-in.
